# Hi there! üëã 

My name is Eudald Sangenis, and I'm from Girona, Spain. I hold an M.S. degree in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department from UCI (University of California, Irvine), and a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Electronics and Automatic Control Engineering from UPC (Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya).

üî¨ Right now, I'm a PhD candidate in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at UC Irvine, California.  
üìö My research focuses on **indoor localization algorithms**, **AR headsets**, and **pedestrian path planning** for indoor environments.  
üõ† My expertise lies in **pedestrian indoor navigation**, **inertial navigation**, and **pedestrian path planning algorithms**. I'm also passionate about **far-target detection of points of interest in indoor spaces**, and creating **immersive AR/VR mixed reality experiences**.

## My Research Projects

**NEVERLOST** is a three-year project funded by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, aimed at developing an indoor navigation platform for firefighters‚Äîsimilar to "Google Maps" but designed for environments where GNSS is unavailable. My research focuses on:

- **Pedestrian Indoor Localization:** Implementing advanced algorithms to accurately determine the location of individuals indoors.
- **Far-Target Detection:** Identifying points of interest in indoor spaces for location-based services.
- **Indoor Pedestrian Path Planning:** Optimizing routes within indoor environments to enhance operational efficiency for firefighters.
- **Mixed Reality (MR) Integration:** Utilizing AR headsets to guide pedestrians indoors, creating a comprehensive navigation platform that supports real-time navigation.
