# Hi there! 👋 I'm Eudald Sangenis!

🔬 I'm a PhD candidate in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at UC Irvine, California.  
📚 My research focuses on **indoor localization algorithms**, **AR headsets**, and **pedestrian path planning** for indoor environments.  
🛠 My expertise lies in **pedestrian indoor navigation**, **inertial navigation**, and **pedestrian path planning algorithms**. I'm also passionate about **far-target detection of points of interest in indoor spaces**, and creating **immersive AR/VR mixed reality experiences**.

## My Research Projects

### **NEVERLOST**
I'm currently conducting research at UC Irvine, funded by NIST. The goal of the **NEVERLOST** project is to develop an indoor navigation system akin to "Google Maps" for environments where GNSS is unavailable, such as during firefighting operations. My research focuses on:
- **Pedestrian indoor localization** using advanced algorithms.
- **Far-target detection** for identifying points of interest in indoor spaces for location-based services.
- **Indoor pedestrian path planning**.
- **Mixed Reality (MR) integration** with AR headsets to enhance user experiences.
